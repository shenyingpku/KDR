"""Tutorial to predict the sex of a baby from the name.

This model takes a dataset of baby names to ratio of sexes for that name and
then trains an LSTM to predict the ratio given the characters of the name.

The input are the characters of the name as ASCII codes (0-127) and it is
unrolled for 15 steps, which is the longest name in the corpus.  The results are
fed through a recurrent network and then to a 2 way classifier that predicts the
boy/girl ratio.

This demonstrates how to train a classifier on the last output using an LSTM,
which can be at any point (some names are short and some are long) by setting
weights on each example. This also demonstrates how to efficiently reshape the
network for the classifier and how to use dropout in both a training and eval
graph.
